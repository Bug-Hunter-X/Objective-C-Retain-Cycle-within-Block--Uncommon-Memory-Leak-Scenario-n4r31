This bug demonstrates an uncommon issue in Objective-C related to the misuse of `self` within a block.  Specifically, accessing `self` within a block that's retained by a longer-lived object (e.g., a timer or completion handler) can lead to a retain cycle if not handled correctly.  If `self` is strongly captured within the block and the block retains the object `self` refers to which in turn retains the block, we have a cycle. This can prevent the deallocation of `self` even when it's no longer needed, potentially leading to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.
